# hello-world

Hello everyone!

This is meant for testing stuff and getting familiar with github

A little more about myself:
I am starting to learn programming through Python. I'm still a noob but hopefully i can edit this message soon ;D
I'd love to learn how to make websites and how to mess with already existing sites ;P For that, i'd have to learn some programming languages I guess, but I am not sure which ones yet. Feel free to message me! (If that's even possible on here). If you want to contact me, here is my e-mail: hirocodee@gmail.com
