# hello-world
this is meant for testing stuff and getting familiar with github

i am starting to learn programming through python. i'm still a noob but hopefully i can edit this message soon ;D
i'd love to learn how to make websites and how to mess with already existing sites ;P for that, i'd have to learn some programming languages i guess, but i'm not sure which ones yet. feel free to message me! (if that's even possible on here). if you want to contact me, here is my e-mail: hirocodee@gmail.com
